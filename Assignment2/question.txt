ASSIGNMENT #2:
Suppose, we have a C source program scanned and filtered as it was done in Session 1. We now take
that modified file as input, and separate the lexemes first. We further recognize and mark the
lexemes as different types of tokens like keywords, identifiers, operators, separators, parenthesis,
numbers, etc.
